-----------------
In this interview, we'll test your software design skills with an open-ended problem. We'll collaborate using what ever document editor you're comfortable with: Notion, Google Docs, or a plaintext file.

Some people find it useful to draw architecture diagrams in this exercise. Since we'll be having this discussion remotely, you can use [Google Drawings](http://docs.google.com/drawings) or [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/), but please do whatever you're most comfortable with (we're evaluating your software design knowledge here, not your familiarity with tools).
