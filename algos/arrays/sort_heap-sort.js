// heap is an ordered binary tree
// max heap has the parent nodes greater than the child nodes
// continuously create max heaps to find the largest item
// remove that item and place it in the sorted partition

// represent tree as arr (list w/ bfs)
// call maxHeap(arr) -> sorted largest to smallest
